openbox (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Be aware of the following changes when upgrading to openbox 3.5
  or later:

    - There is a new config file called environment that you should 
      copy from /etc/xdg/openbox to ~/.config/openbox
    - The config file previously called autostart.sh is now just called
      autostart. You should rename yours to remove the .sh from the end
      of the name.
    - Some of the configuration grammar in rc.xml has changed. While Openbox
      appears to understand the old options, it would be wise to compare
      your configuration to the one in /etc/xdg/openbox and look for changes
      that affect you.

openbox (3.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  - The 3.4.x release introduced quite a few changes and improvements
    for users. Make sure to read:
    http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Help:Upgrading_to_3.4
    to take advantage of them.

openbox (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  - Openbox 3 is rewritten from scratch in C, and is now licenced under the
    GNU General Public Licence.  Prior versions of Openbox was written in
    C++, and based on Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
    
    The format for configuration files, menu files, and theme files has
    been changed, so if you're upgrading from Openbox 2, you will have to
    convert your existing setup to the new formats.  The included script
    /usr/share/openbox/themeupdate.py may be helpful when converting themes,
    while configuration and menu files must be done manually.

    You might want to postpone upgrading this package (or downgrade it
    if you already have), if you do not want to do the conversion now.
